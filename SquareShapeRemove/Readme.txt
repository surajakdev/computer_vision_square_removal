Project Name: Square Shape Removal.

Aim: To remove the square displaying on video captured realtime by systems web cam.

Description: The sqaure shape will be displayed whenever their is a hand shown in camera above a pre marked virtual line in the screen where video 	     is displayed. This marked line can be seen at the botttom of the screen. Noticebly, if the the hand is brought below that line 		     square shape will be removed.

Library used: cv2, mediapipe, time, numpy.

cv2: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing.
     It includes functions for image manipulation, object detection, feature extraction, and more.

mediapipe: Mediapipe is a library developed by Google that provides solutions for various perception tasks, including hand tracking, pose      	   	   detection, face detection, and more.

time: The time module in Python provides functions for working with time-related tasks, such as measuring elapsed time, adding delays, and more.

numpy: NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along        	with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. When working with computer vision tasks, it's common to use a combination of these 	libraries to manipulate images, perform various analyses, and extract useful information from visual data.
